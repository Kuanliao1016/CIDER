# CIDER - Clinically Important Difference Estimation and Rating using an anchor-based approach

A clinically important difference is crucial for estimating the minimal sample size in clinical trials that use patient-reported outcome measures as the primary outcome. 

We developed this shiny app tool to help researchers estimate either within-group or between-group clinically important differences through an anchor-based approach. The R shiny app is now available at:https://kuanliao.shinyapps.io/CIDER/. Relevant publications will be shared.
